# Ovarian Cancer Immune Repertoire Analysis

This project involves the analysis of immune repertoire data obtained from the blood samples of healthy donors and ovarian cancer patients. 
The immune repertoire data includes T-cell receptor alpha (TRA) and beta (TRB) sequences obtained through Repertoire Sequencing (Rep-Seq). 
The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature filtering, and machine learning for classification.

## Data Collection and Processing

1. **Blood Collection:**
   - Blood samples were collected from healthy donors and ovarian cancer patients.

2. **Repertoire Sequencing (Rep-Seq):**
   - Repertoire Sequencing was performed on the collected blood samples to obtain TRA and TRB sequences.

3. **Data Processing with MiXCR:**
   - The obtained raw sequencing data went through the MiXCR pipeline for processing.

4. **Concatenation of TRA and TRB Files:**
   - The processed TRA and TRB files were concatenated for further analysis.

## Data Analysis

### Immunarch Analysis

- **immunarch_analysis.Rmd:**
  - This R Markdown document performs subsampling on the concatenated data and conducts basic analyses using the `immunarch` package.

### Feature Filtering

- **feature_filtering.Rmd:**
  - This R Markdown document implements two different methods for feature filtering on the concatenated data.

## Machine Learning

- **ML_atom_SFM.ipynb:**
  - This Jupyter Notebook contains a Python script for machine learning.
  - The data resulting from `feature_filtering.Rmd` is processed through this notebook.
  - Machine learning algorithms are applied for classification using the `atom` package.

## Usage

- The analysis can be reproduced by following the steps outlined in each analysis script.
- Ensure that the required dependencies (such as R packages and Python libraries) are installed.
- The project was developed and tested with the following package versions:
   - Python: 3.8.13
   - NumPy: 1.21.2
   - Pandas: 1.4.1
   - Scikit-learn: 1.0.2
   - atom-ml 4.12.0
- To reproduce the environment, `conda env create -f environment.yml`.

## Data Availability

- The raw data is available on Zenodo.
- Data resulting from the second feature filtering method is available in the "data_16_ab.csv" file.
